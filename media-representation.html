      <h3>Mainstream Media Silence</h3>
      <p>
      	It has been revealed that the media fails to include MMIW stories in their reporting. Out of the 506 cases examined by the Urban Indian Health 
	Institute, local / national news covered about 1/4th of those. It’s even less likely that the media continues to produce foll-ups to the stories

      <h3>Indigenous Storytelling</h3>
      <p>
      	Some Indigenous storytellers came together to create the docuseries, “Murder in Bighorn.” The series features and brings the issue of MMIW to the 
	spotlight. The creator made sure to involve Indigenous voices and perspectives to “properly tell the story”
