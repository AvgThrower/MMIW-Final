      <h3>Indigenous Led Movement : The REDress Project </h3>
      <p>
	      The Redress Project was an installation of red dresses made to focus on the MMIW crisis created by Jaime Black, a member of the Metis nation. Her goal was 
	      to bring awareness to racialized and gendered crimes against Indigenous women and people. The project places the Indigenous women's body as a target of violence. 
	      Through doing this she reclaimed space for Indigenous women's presence. She attempted to create a conversation about the social and political issues involving Indigenous people
